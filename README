INTRODUCTION

  This is a fork of the original ISPConfig 3 svn repository. 

  Information on ISPConfig can be found here:

    * Website:    http://www.ispconfig.org
    * Forum:      http://howtoforge.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=23
    * Bugtracker: http://bugtracker.ispconfig.org/index.php?project=3
    * SVN:        svn://svn.ispconfig.org/ispconfig3/trunk

  I have created this fork to do some personal coding on ispconfig3.
  The finished improvements/patches will be sent upstream.


BRANCHES

  master: 
    In this branch, I tend to merge all other branches that are deemed i
    to be finished.

  upstream: 
    This branch is kept in sync with the svn repository.

  getmail-readall:
    Adjustments to allow users to select the 'read all' option when 
    running getmail. With this set to on, read emails will also be 
    fetch from the remote mailserver.

  apache_ssl_directives:
    Split out the 'Apache Directives' section. HTTP and HTTPS now can 
    have 2 both entirely different directives sections.
